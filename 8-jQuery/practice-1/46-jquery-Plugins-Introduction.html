        <p>Busy-ness is part of a broader set of structures that limit our choices
        and our ability to feel satisfied. What we call the “hegemony of busy-ness” 
        refers two interrelated processes. First, busyness is a powerful cultural pressure.
        Second, and more importantly, this busy-ness perpetuates the social system that
        makes the rich richer and creates more and more economically vulnerable people. 
        We are impelled to do more and to want to do more, but busy-ness limits our ability
        to improve our overall happiness, promote greater equity, or save our endangered planet.
        Our global economic and political order fuels a state of constant activity, and 
        busy-ness harms both individual and community well-being. There’s so much information 
        thrown at us, we just don’t know where to start. Time poverty limits our ability to
        talk with neighbors and nurture communities. If time is money for some, it is also what
        gives meaning to our lives. Busy-ness disconnects us from our social habitats by preoccupying 
        us with endless tasks and often meaningless information.
        The upshot is that busy-ness undermines our physical and mental health as well as
        our ability to think and learn. Modern society has transformed homo sapiens into what
        former technology professional and Consciously Digital founder Anastasia Dedyukhina calls
        homo distractus -people who are continuously inundated with information and perpetually distracted.</p>
