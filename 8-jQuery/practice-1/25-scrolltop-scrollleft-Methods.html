<p>It is then quite obvious that Pakistan remains prone
    to a variety of climatic hazards, with global warming – 
    according to experts in several reports published this year – 
    contributing to this. It is still uncertain that we have
    sufficient plans in place to cope with any problem that may occur.
    The NDMA and PDMAs are all operative. But in the past, we have 
    found they have lacked the resources to offer much in terms 
    of rescue and rehabilitation, with the armed forces usually 
    taking over this task. The early issuing of flood warnings 
    this year means that there is plenty of time to act. 
    In the weeks we still have ahead before the full force of the 
    monsoon strikes, we should be working out systems involving 
    the evacuation of the most vulnerable populations where necessary 
    and ensuring rescuers are available on the ground in areas most
    likely to be hit by floods. This is a strategy being used around 
    the world, where local people are trained in advance so that they
    can offer immediate help without waiting for aid and expertise to 
    be brought in from other places. In the past, Pakistan has suffered
    terrible consequences as a result of flood. We should look back at
    the lessons from these natural calamities and devise a strategy to 
    avoid people falling into greater danger and greater hardship.</p>
