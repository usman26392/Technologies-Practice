        <p>All stakeholders involved in Afghanistan need to 
        recognise that there is no alternative to peace. 
        The country has been torn apart by a war that has
         essentially continued since 1979 and even before that year.
        Tens of thousands of people have been killed, many have fled
     the country, families have been destroyed and persons maimed by
      the violence can be spotted everywhere in a country that
     literally stumbles to survive. This should not be acceptable
      to Afghanistan.</p>
