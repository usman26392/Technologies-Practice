# points for loop:
# formula
number of 'swiper-slide' on html >= slidesPerView * 2;


*) if take swiper-slide 6 on html
than slidePerview  6 / 2 = 3 in js 


*) if we take slidesPerView in js = 3
number of 'swiper-slide' = 3 * 2 = 6 on html
6 means we should take six or greater than six swiper-slide on html.
