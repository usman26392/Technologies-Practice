// Conditional rendering in React refers to the ability to render different parts of a component's UI based on certain conditions. It allows you to control which elements are displayed or how they are displayed based on the state of your application or the props passed to the component.

// In this example, the ProfileLogin component renders a different message based on the value of the isLoggedIn prop. If isLoggedIn is true, it displays a "Welcome back!" message; otherwise, it displays a "Please log in" message. The App component then uses the ProfileLogin component and passes the userIsLoggedIn value as a prop.



function ProfileLogin(props) {
    const isLogIn = props.isLoggedIn;
    // Conditional rendering based on the value of isLogIn
    if(isLogIn) {
        return <h1>Welcome back in APP!</h1>
    }
    else {
        return <h1>Please log in</h1>
    }
}

export default ProfileLogin

//  Conditional rendering can be achieved using various techniques, including:

// 1. **Using the `if` statement:**
//    ```jsx
//    if (condition) {
//      // render something
//    } else {
//      // render something else
//    }
//    ```

// 2. **Using the ternary operator:**
//    ```jsx
//    return condition ? <ComponentA /> : <ComponentB />;
//    ```

// 3. **Using logical '&&' operator for short-circuit evaluation:**
//    ```jsx
//    return condition && <Component />;
//    ```

// 4. **Using `switch` statements:**
//    ```jsx
//    switch (value) {
//      case 'option1':
//        // render something
//        break;
//      case 'option2':
//        // render something else
//        break;
//      default:
//        // render a default case
//    }
//    ```

// Conditional rendering is a powerful feature in React, allowing you to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces that adapt to different states and conditions in your application.



//---------------- purpose of conditional rendering 

// Conditional rendering in React serves several purposes, allowing developers to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces. Some key purposes include:

// 1. **Dynamic UI:** Conditional rendering enables the creation of UI components that can adapt and change based on different conditions, such as user interactions, authentication status, or data availability. This results in a more interactive and engaging user experience.

// 2. **User Authentication:** It is common to conditionally render components based on whether a user is authenticated or not. For example, showing different content to logged-in users compared to non-logged-in users, or displaying a login form when authentication is required.

// 3. **Data Fetching and Loading:** Conditional rendering is often used when fetching data from an API. Components can display loading spinners or placeholders while waiting for data to arrive and then render the actual content when the data is available.

// 4. **Error Handling:** Components can conditionally render error messages or fallback UI when an error occurs during data fetching, user input validation, or other operations.

// 5. **Form Validation:** In forms, you might conditionally render error messages or visual cues based on the validity of user input. This helps guide users and provide feedback on their interactions.

// 6. **Conditional Styling:** You can conditionally apply styles to elements based on certain conditions, such as highlighting a selected item or applying different styles to elements depending on their state.

// 7. **Responsive Design:** Conditional rendering is crucial for building responsive web applications. You can conditionally render different components or styles based on the screen size or orientation, providing an optimal experience on various devices.

// 8. **Feature Toggling:** It allows developers to conditionally render components or features based on feature flags or toggles. This is useful for A/B testing, progressive feature rollout, or enabling/disabling features based on certain conditions.

// 9. **User Role Management:** Components can be conditionally rendered based on the user's role or permissions. This is common in applications where different roles have access to different parts of the interface.

// By leveraging conditional rendering, React developers can build flexible and robust applications that respond intelligently to changing conditions, enhancing the overall user experience and usability of the application.
