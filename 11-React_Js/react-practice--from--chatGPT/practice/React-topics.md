            we can render a component outside the DOM root element (where id="root" ). use for modal or popups
  - HOC: 
        A pattern where a component is wrapped with another component to enhance its functionality.
  - Render Props: 
                A technique for sharing code between React components using a 'prop' whose value is a function.

# hooks
 - useState(): local state management.
 - useEffect(): any code that needs to be executed after the component renders.
 - useContext(): similar concept of context API.
 - useReducer(): for global state management, similar to redux.
 - useCallback(): use for performance optimization. only render that component, that will be updated.
 - useMemo(): use for performance optimization and pure component
 - useRef(): we can directly access DOM nodes with the help of useRef() hook.
 - use custom hook: alternative to HOC.
